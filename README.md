USER STORY

AS A music enthusiast
I WANT to log in with my Spotify account information and create my musical preferences profile that will contain name; photo; about-me (description); Spotify information; my email address.
SO THAT I can search other users on database and find fiends with similar music tastes based.

AS A USER I want to access and edit the list of suggested friends
SO THAT users whose profiles I do not select will not appear in my future searches.
